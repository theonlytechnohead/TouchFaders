## What is this?
The YAMAHA® LS9 digital mixing console for audio is a fantastically capable device. There exists three issues with it:

1. No DCA's is a very unfortunate omission, especially considering the M7CL series has them (and released a year earlier!)
1. Input-to-Matrix is not supported ☹ (again, M7CL getting all the love)
1. Only one remote device can control the desk at a time (and the only mobile device that can do so is an iPad, with the StageMix app from YAMAHA®)

Unfortunately, I can't easily fix 1 or 2, so instead I decided to focus my efforts on 3.  
*This program is the solution*

## How does it work?
There's a [wiki page](../../wiki/How-this-works) to explain everything

## Instructions for use:
See the [guide](../../wiki/Guide) on how to get started

## I want to do something similar to this, but I don't know how!
I've written up just about everything I know about this, on [this page](../../wiki/Data-decoding) in the wiki

## I can make this so much better
Please make a pull request when you do, otherwise suggestions via the 'Issues' tab are appreciated
